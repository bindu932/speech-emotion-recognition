"This project aims to develop a speech emotion recognition system using deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs),
to accurately classify emotions from audio recordings, thereby enabling the development of affective computing applications that can improve human-computer interaction, mental health diagnosis, 
and emotional intelligence. The system will be trained on a diverse dataset of speech samples, leveraging techniques such as data augmentation and transfer learning to enhance its generalization abilities. 
The project will evaluate the performance of the system using metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, and mean squared error, and will explore the potential applications of speech emotion recognition in various fields,
including psychology, marketing, and healthcare. By developing a robust and accurate speech emotion recognition system,
this project seeks to contribute to the advancement of affective computing and natural language processing, and to demonstrate the potential of machine learning in understanding human emotions."
